class LogisticRegression(BaseEstimator, LinearClassifierMixin,
                         SparseCoefMixin):
    """Logistic Regression (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier.

    In the multiclass case, the training algorithm uses the one-vs-rest (OvR)
    scheme if the 'multi_class' option is set to 'ovr', and uses the cross-
    entropy loss if the 'multi_class' option is set to 'multinomial'.
    (Currently the 'multinomial' option is supported only by the 'lbfgs',
    'sag' and 'newton-cg' solvers.)

    This class implements regularized logistic regression using the
    'liblinear' library, 'newton-cg', 'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers. It can handle
    both dense and sparse input. Use C-ordered arrays or CSR matrices
    containing 64-bit floats for optimal performance; any other input format
    will be converted (and copied).

    The 'newton-cg', 'sag', and 'lbfgs' solvers support only L2 regularization
    with primal formulation. The 'liblinear' solver supports both L1 and L2
    regularization, with a dual formulation only for the L2 penalty.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <logistic_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    penalty : str, 'l1' or 'l2', default: 'l2'
        Used to specify the norm used in the penalization. The 'newton-cg',
        'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers support only l2 penalties.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19
           l1 penalty with SAGA solver (allowing 'multinomial' + L1)

    dual : bool, default: False
        Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only implemented for
        l2 penalty with liblinear solver. Prefer dual=False when
        n_samples > n_features.

    tol : float, default: 1e-4
        Tolerance for stopping criteria.

    C : float, default: 1.0
        Inverse of regularization strength; must be a positive float.
        Like in support vector machines, smaller values specify stronger
        regularization.

    fit_intercept : bool, default: True
        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be
        added to the decision function.

    intercept_scaling : float, default 1.
        Useful only when the solver 'liblinear' is used
        and self.fit_intercept is set to True. In this case, x becomes
        [x, self.intercept_scaling],
        i.e. a "synthetic" feature with constant value equal to
        intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.
        The intercept becomes ``intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight``.

        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization
        as all other features.
        To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight
        (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased.

    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', default: None
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.

        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.

        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
        through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           *class_weight='balanced'*

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default: None
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator to use when shuffling
        the data.  If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number
        generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number
        generator; If None, the random number generator is the RandomState
        instance used by `np.random`. Used when ``solver`` == 'sag' or
        'liblinear'.

    solver : str, {'newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'sag', 'saga'},
        default: 'liblinear'
        Algorithm to use in the optimization problem.

        - For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag' and
          'saga' are faster for large ones.
        - For multiclass problems, only 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs'
          handle multinomial loss; 'liblinear' is limited to one-versus-rest
          schemes.
        - 'newton-cg', 'lbfgs' and 'sag' only handle L2 penalty, whereas
          'liblinear' and 'saga' handle L1 penalty.

        Note that 'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on
        features with approximately the same scale. You can
        preprocess the data with a scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.
        .. versionadded:: 0.19
           SAGA solver.

    max_iter : int, default: 100
        Useful only for the newton-cg, sag and lbfgs solvers.
        Maximum number of iterations taken for the solvers to converge.

    multi_class : str, {'ovr', 'multinomial'}, default: 'ovr'
        Multiclass option can be either 'ovr' or 'multinomial'. If the option
        chosen is 'ovr', then a binary problem is fit for each label. Else
        the loss minimised is the multinomial loss fit across
        the entire probability distribution. Does not work for 'liblinear'
        solver.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver for 'multinomial' case.

    verbose : int, default: 0
        For the liblinear and lbfgs solvers set verbose to any positive
        number for verbosity.

    warm_start : bool, default: False
        When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as
        initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.
        Useless for liblinear solver. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           *warm_start* to support *lbfgs*, *newton-cg*, *sag*, *saga* solvers.

    n_jobs : int, default: 1
        Number of CPU cores used when parallelizing over classes if
        multi_class='ovr'". This parameter is ignored when the ``solver``is set
        to 'liblinear' regardless of whether 'multi_class' is specified or
        not. If given a value of -1, all cores are used.

    Attributes
    ----------

    coef_ : array, shape (1, n_features) or (n_classes, n_features)
        Coefficient of the features in the decision function.

        `coef_` is of shape (1, n_features) when the given problem is binary.
        In particular, when `multi_class='multinomial'`, `coef_` corresponds
        to outcome 1 (True) and `-coef_` corresponds to outcome 0 (False).

    intercept_ : array, shape (1,) or (n_classes,)
        Intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to the decision function.

        If `fit_intercept` is set to False, the intercept is set to zero.
        `intercept_` is of shape (1,) when the given problem is binary.
        In particular, when `multi_class='multinomial'`, `intercept_`
        corresponds to outcome 1 (True) and `-intercept_` corresponds to
        outcome 0 (False).

    n_iter_ : array, shape (n_classes,) or (1, )
        Actual number of iterations for all classes. If binary or multinomial,
        it returns only 1 element. For liblinear solver, only the maximum
        number of iteration across all classes is given.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20

            In SciPy <= 1.0.0 the number of lbfgs iterations may exceed
            ``max_iter``. ``n_iter_`` will now report at most ``max_iter``.

    Notes
    -----
    The underlying C implementation uses a random number generator to
    select features when fitting the model. It is thus not uncommon,
    to have slightly different results for the same input data. If
    that happens, try with a smaller tol parameter.

    Predict output may not match that of standalone liblinear in certain
    cases. See :ref:`differences from liblinear <liblinear_differences>`
    in the narrative documentation.
