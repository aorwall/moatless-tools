"""Compute Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <roc_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples]
        True binary labels. If labels are not either {-1, 1} or {0, 1}, then
        pos_label should be explicitly given.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by "decision_function" on some classifiers).

    pos_label : int or str, default=None
        Label considered as positive and others are considered negative.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    drop_intermediate : boolean, optional (default=True)
        Whether to drop some suboptimal thresholds which would not appear
        on a plotted ROC curve. This is useful in order to create lighter
        ROC curves.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           parameter *drop_intermediate*.

    Returns
    -------
    fpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing false positive rates such that element i is the false
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].

    tpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing true positive rates such that element i is the true
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].

    thresholds : array, shape = [n_thresholds]
        Decreasing thresholds on the decision function used to compute
        fpr and tpr. `thresholds[0]` represents no instances being predicted
        and is arbitrarily set to `max(y_score) + 1`.

    See also
    --------
    roc_auc_score : Compute the area under the ROC curve

    Notes
    -----
    Since the thresholds are sorted from low to high values, they
    are reversed upon returning them to ensure they correspond to both ``fpr``
    and ``tpr``, which are sorted in reversed order during their calculation.

    # appear on a plotted ROC curve (and thus do not affect the AUC).

    # is a corner at the point. Both fps and tps must be tested to handle
    # thresholds with multiple data points (which are combined in
    # _binary_clf_curve). This keeps all cases where the point should be kept,
    # but does not drop more complicated cases like fps = [1, 3, 7],
    # tps = [1, 2, 4]; there is no harm in keeping too many thresholds.
